# CustomDiscordRPC
#### Version: 0004

Customisable Discord Rich Presence Client/Updater written in C#.

Allows for your own custom state of rich presence on Discord.

You need to [make your own Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create) on the [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) page and paste the Client ID of the [RPC App](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) in the app config.

You can download the latest executable and DLL on the releases page.

All code is open-source, I wrote all but the `DiscordRpc.cs` Class. I'm using a modified version I made myself in this app.

If you choose to use this app as a simple executable then go ahead!, when launched this app will also check for updates on this repo and will notify you via the Action Center. It will not auto update it though, this is because i also intend this app for developers to deconstruct and look at to learn from.

I will add further documentation and maybe attach a YouTube video on how to setup the [App](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
